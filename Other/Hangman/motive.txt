Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me.
Good, better, best. Never let it rest. 'Til your good is better and your better is best.
Life is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react to it.
It always seems impossible until it's done.
Start where you are. Use what you have. Do what you can.
Keep your eyes on the stars, and your feet on the ground.
If you can dream it, you can do it.
The secret of getting ahead is getting started.
If you're going through hell, keep going.
Aim for the moon. If you miss, you may hit a star.
Set your goals high, and don't stop till you get there.
It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.
Don't stop when you're tired. Stop when you are done. 
Don't talk, just act. Don't say, just show. Don't promise, just prove.
Don't limit your challenges, challenge your limits. 
Expect problems and eat them for breakfast.
What comes easy won't last. What lasts won't come easy. 
Work hard in silence, let success be your noise. 
Life begins at the end of your comfort zone.
Stars cannot shine without darkness.
