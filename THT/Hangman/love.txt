There is only one happiness in this life, to love and be loved.
Being deeply loved by someone gives you strength, while loving someone deeply gives you courage.
Let us always meet each other with smile, for the smile is the beginning of love.
If you love someone, set them free. If they come back they're yours; if they don't they never were.
Love all, trust a few, do wrong to none.
Friends show their love in times of trouble, not in happiness.
There is no love without forgiveness, and there is no forgiveness without love.
True love stories never have endings.
Darkness cannot drive out darkness; only light can do that. Hate cannot drive out hate; only love can do that.
A flower doesn't love you or hate you, it just exists.
I look at you and see the rest of my life in front of my eyes.
I'm much more me when I'm with you.
The heart wants what it wants. There's no logic to these things. You meet someone and you fall in love and that's that.
At the touch of love everyone becomes a poet.
Thinking of you keeps me awake. Dreaming of you keeps me asleep. Being with you keeps me alive.
We are shaped and fashioned by those we love.
The greatest thing you'll ever learn is to love and be loved in return.
Better to have lost and loved than never to have loved at all.
All you need is love. But a little chocolate now and then doesn't hurt.
I don't hate you, I love you. But loving you is killing me. So this is goodbye, even if I don't want it to be.
